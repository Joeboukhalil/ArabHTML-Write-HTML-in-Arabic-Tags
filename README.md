# عربHTML – Arabic-Friendly HTML Style Markup

**عربHTML** (ArabHTML) is a simple, educational tool and custom markup style designed to help Arabic speakers learn and write web page code using Arabic terms that resemble HTML structure.

## What is عربHTML?

عربHTML is **not a new web standard** and it is **not officially supported by web browsers**. It is a **custom educational markup system** that allows you to write HTML-style code using Arabic words, which is then converted to standard HTML using a built-in converter.

### Example

Instead of writing:

```html
<p>مرحبًا بالعالم</p>

You can write:

<مقطع>مرحبًا بالعالم</مقطع>

And our converter will turn it into valid HTML:

<p>مرحبًا بالعالم</p>

**Why Use عربHTML?**

- Accessibility: Makes it easier for beginners or native Arabic speakers to understand the structure and purpose of HTML tags.

- Education: Can be used in classrooms and workshops for teaching web development concepts in Arabic.

- Customization: Serves as a fun and functional way to experiment with the logic of markup languages.


**How It Works**

1. You write code in Arabic-style tags using our web editor.


2. Press the "تحويل" (Convert) button to see the translated HTML code.


3. You can then copy the output and use it anywhere standard HTML is accepted.
